# MultithreadedTC

A port of [MultithreadedTC](https://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/PL/multithreadedtc/) to junit5.

The code here is derived from the MultithreadedTC-1.01 source distribution.
Most of the thread management capability has been carried over to a junit5 context.
Usage examples can be found in the 'test' directory.

## New Features
- Migrated Makefile to Maven pom.xml
- Moved source code into standard Maven directory structure (src/main/java, src/test/java)
- Upgraded from Java 16 to Java 21
